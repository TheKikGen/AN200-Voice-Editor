### Notice
I have no AN200 hardware anymore, further development has been halted.

## Yamaha AN200 Voice Editor

What can it do:

- Send / receive almost all the parameters via SysEx / MIDI CC messages
- Manipulate Free EG values
- Save / Load MIDI Bulk SysEx dump files to / from AN200
- Save / Load single programs  as *.syx files
- Receiving MIDI bulk dumps directly from device

PS: since this panel is oriented only on a synth part of the device, there are no controls related to the stepsequencer / drum parts.

### Download
All files are available to download on the [latest Release](https://github.com/inteyes/AN200-Voice-Editor/releases/latest) page of this repository. Be sure to check it out and grab the file that suits your needs.

### Important note
Before you start: this panel using extended instructions set, so you need to turn on extended MIDI control change mode on your device.

### Afterword
Thanks to the guys Possemo, dnaldoog and goodweather for the tips and tricks!

This panel was created using great [Ctrlr software](https://github.com/RomanKubiak/ctrlr). While you are able to run Ctrlr on your system - you are able to run this panel.
